Accessible web sites are important. Moblie first development is
also key ensuring the greatest access to web based information for
the American public.

Technology Transformation Services in the General Service
Administration is trying to make tools that build accessibility
testing into the software development practice.

This is module is part of many designed to make that possible:

* [continua11y](https://github.com/18f/contiua11y-due): a web dashboard and API for displaying
  accessibility reports in a friendly manner, and providing
accessibility badges.
* [continua11y-acceptance](https://github.com/18f/node-contiua11y-acceptance): easy node based acceptance testing that
  also writes json reports to the file system
* [continua11y-ci-reporter](https://github.com/18f/contiua11y-due): This project, a command line tool for sending the
  generated json reports to continua11y.

Under the covers our work relies on the [pa11y
library](https://githubs.com/pa11y/pa11y).
